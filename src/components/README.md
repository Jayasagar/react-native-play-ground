Create the components which can be used global through out the application.
Components can be nested, if so then child components can use in its parent ONLY. No where they should be used.

The main components of application could be buttons, form fields. Complex ones could be commentList.

Root level components can be used anywhere, but nested component can be used oNLY in parent component.
